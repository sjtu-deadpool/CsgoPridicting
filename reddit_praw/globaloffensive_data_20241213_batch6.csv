* Their Semi Final is against their rivals (Plus regional opponents: Both teams were from the Americas vs. Both teams are EU mixes)

1hdc3vi,I hope the final is Faze Vs Spirit to mirror Katowice. Who do you want to win and why?,"As the title says. 

1. It would be a cool narrative going full circle from the event that started this year to the one that finished it.
2. I like that Karrigan and Donk are basically complete opposites: A winner nearing the end of his career and a prodigy just beginning it. Whoever wins will build their legacy off of the corpse of the other
3. It would be a great way to truly show the parity of this year in elite tournaments. 
Spirit wins Katowice, Vitality wins Cologne, Navi wins the major, and Faze wins the one at the end. Faze was in the running at the beginning of the year to be the best team in the world, if you count all their finals and how consistent they were, if they get the major + chengdu they still can't be the team of the year as Na'Vi has that locked down imo but it would still be a year where the best team only won like 3 more events than the next five. 

4. I've a massive Karrigan fan but even I feel like I can't call him the GOAT IGL until the has at least 2 majors. I think in terms of skill at the role he's better than Gla1ve, but this would be the last piece in his resume that just shows it. 



Obviously it will be cool no matter who wins at this point. Donk could solidify the GOAT rookie year, Mouz could shed their choker status and all become champions before the teams splits up, FaZe's legacy solidified in more ways than one, Niko and M0nesy winning a major together before they potentially split would also be great (as well as Malbs getting one so early what?), but either way this is a great major playoffs and I truly love this game.

1hd8cef,I realised why Run N Gun is a thing,"Wasn't just Twistzz - lots of others complained about why RnG is now a thing in CS2 - even though the mechanics haven't changed since CSGO.

I was new to CS with CS2 - and for me ""Follow recoil"" on the crosshair was extremely useful - even though I have put time in to learning spray patterns.

If you go back to the CS2 launch, you see a lot of longer-term players trying Follow-Recoil, but rejecting it as it messed with their muscle memory - which is fair enough.

But as I got into CS2 with it on, I've just stuck with it, and it obviously makes Run N Gun much easier if you're able to track the crosshair.

1hczjfo,minimap/radar shows wrong positions of enemies and teammates (certain resolutions),"Hey there, ill get straight to the point:

the minimap shows wrong positions of enemies/teammates when looking east or west. the positions are only right when u are facing north or south

this problem occurs when using any resolution that isnt standard aspect ratio. e.g. 1080x1080, 1280x1080, etc etc

on 4:3, 16:9 or 16:10 resolutions this doesnt appear to be a problem at all.

i know for a fact this wasnt a problem in csgo,as a returning player now needing to get comfortable with a new res is pretty unfortunate for me.

note: this problem can be prevented by disabling radar rotation, with a fixed minimap the positions are right, unfortunately i get sick seeing a static minimap from just being used to having centered, rotation radar for the past 5k hours of playtime...

if any of you guys experience the same issue, want to double check what im saying or in case you know a fix to this issue please feel free to reach out to me!

edit:   
example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHRBqYTxsSs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHRBqYTxsSs) (not my recording)  
if u want to reproduce this, u can place a bot into window, stand in top mid urself and change view angles from east to west and you will see that the radar and the enemies position is correct when u are facing north or south, it is indeed wrong though when looking towards east and west.   
in my specific case, the bot is displayed within \*kitchen\* instead of window when facing it window - hence its impossible to actually use the given information and play a regular game...   
back to 4:3 i go... :/

This is a 10 min clip of me playing deathmatch, I currently sit at 5.4k elo in premier, gold nova 3 in wingman and dont rly play comp, I am looking for advice on what I could improve based on this clip",0,_Dudexh_,2024-12-12 20:25:27,16,"['I had to watch 20 seconds to see a few issues:\n\nYou are instantly crouching when you see enemies - this is bad, you only want to crouch when tyou know you have an isolated fight as crouching makes you imobile. If you crouch the trade potential on you grows **a lot.**\n\nSecondly, your peeking is bad, you dont really clear angles more so than you simply look in the direction and hoping no one is there, youre checking the angle with your eyes but not with the crosshair.\n\nThis brings me to the thrid issue, your crosshair placement is weird, you look at the ground a lot and swing around your crosshair when peeking angles, this is also a big no no. When peeking you want your crosshair to be fixed while pressing A/D to peek the corner and then recentering the crosshair to peek a different angle. What you are doing is that you are peeking out while also moving your crosshair around at the same time which makes it hard to actually land the shot on the target since you now both have to flick, adjust and counterstrafe at the same time.\n\nYoure spraying too much, ideally you want to burst 3-4 bullets, move -> counterstrafe and then burst again. What you are doing is instantly crouching which makes you easier to hit since you move slowely and you commit to sprays you shouldnt.\n\nIf you can master all of this above, you can climb to 20-25k elo easily, if you want I can send some material thats valuable if you send me a message here on Reddit.', 'Play comp', 'PSA you only need to start pulling down on like the 3rd bullet.

You should watch more than 20seconds. What you said about spraying, that he should burst more is bad advice, why he should even do that, in most cases its impossible to do strafe durring fights unless its very long range. He is completly fine with spraying.\n\nTo the OP, your main issue is crosshairplacement you are looking too low, or on the ground sometimes and you readjust your crosshair, you should be all the time aware of enemy possition, all the time be prepared."", 'Dont, comp is basically deathmatch and everyone is just running around to kill.

Simply pulling down can work for a while, but remembering the recoil: slightly right and hard left after 10 bullets is much more beneficial.', '>and thus I also crouch a lot since it lowers the recoil\n\nYes and no, crouching is done after 4-5 bullets to bring down the recoil to the same level as when you started shooting. Standing vs crouching and spraying is almost identical with crouching being slightly more compact.\n\nInstantly crouching and then spraying is almost the exact same as standing and spraying, jump into recoil master and test it out, spray without recoil control while standing and start from the same level while crouching and you will notice how similar the recoil pattern is.', ""You're flattering me, Ty for the advice, ill focus harder on cross hair placement"", '>i disagree about peeks and clearing angles, for that level he is doing it very good, he is doing counter strafes and usually peeks angles one by one\n\nI watched some more and no, not really.

Move -> Burst -> Move -> Burst is how you win more duels, when watching T1 gameplay that is how every player handles duels, you want to be a target which is hard to hit while still supressing fire. Moving between burst lowers the potential of someone trading you and gives you a chance to reposition. Why would it be impossible? This is a basic mechanic everyone over Faceit 2000 elo knows and uses.\n\n>He is completly fine with spraying.\n\nI watched about two minutes and he lost almost every spray duel except a few where he is shooting them in the back, he is also instantly crouching during his sprays which causes him to die almost every single time.

Just because he readjust his crosshair a lot doesnt mean he is doing it badly, in 5k elo nobody peeks like that because they dont know that they should do it like that.

This is impossible because fights dont take so much time to you be able to strafe and start again and there is lack of velocity gain while being hit lol. Average Time to Damage is less than 500ms in most cases, TTK is another 0.5-1s so good luck with strafing on medium range.
