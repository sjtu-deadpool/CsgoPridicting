He has always had a bit of a longevity issue, he does his best work when he has a new player (or players). I feel like he helps define a meta, but once it's set he struggles to reinvent his teams to stay relevant. \n\nCS2 came and no surprise Karrigan's team dominates, figuring out how to play CS in the new engine with the new smokes is basically Karrigan's wet dream.

I don't know how long it would last though.", "They had enough of the time to perform, they've been with frozen for a full year at this point. They HAVE to change out someone in this roster if they want to hang with the best.

However, I believe the \"real\" reason is that most angles are held in a way that you shoot on your left side. I have absolutely no proof and I am pulling this out of my ass, but from my 2.3k hours of CS, I do think that the \"normal\" map design affects your expectations even when you're not holding an angle like peeking apps or banana.", "Probably part of the problem yeah", "Perhaps, but my main point was that OP's case shouldn't really happen unless they play really \"unusual\" positions or they play left handed which kinda makes their point moot since it isn't the \"intended\" way to play **current** CS.\n\nI know the left handed mode is programmed into the game but the maps are not really made to accommodate the possibility for your gun to block something important.\n\nI am just yapping rn though \n\nso I won't represent anything and I'll just leave it at that"]}
