Someone is always sandbagging hard enough that someone else has to really step up and have a standout performance just for them to stick in games with teams that should be walking", "Broky has been super inconsistent for a while and I'd argue he's not up to par.\n\nThe other possible issue is Karrigan. He has always had a bit of a longevity issue, he does his best work when he has a new player (or players). I feel like he helps define a meta, but once it's set he struggles to reinvent his teams to stay relevant. \n\nCS2 came and no surprise Karrigan's team dominates, figuring out how to play CS in the new engine with the new smokes is basically Karrigan's wet dream. But once he's somewhat defined that meta, his team dips.\n\nReplacing broky might give faze new life, especially since it gives Karrigan a new awp to play around with.  I don't know how long it would last though.", "They had enough of the time to perform, they've been with frozen for a full year at this point. They HAVE to change out someone in this roster if they want to hang with the best. If they won't, they will drop down further because teams such as Falcons, G2, Na'Vi, Vitality will shake up their rosters.
