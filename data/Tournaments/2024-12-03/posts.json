However pros over the years have talked about more tricks in arena, for example if you throw an HE and you hear the explosion in arena, it means you probably naded someone, as the observer deemed it important to observe the HE.\n\nThese are the things that come with the arena environment, there is no real way to fix them.\n\nThere also been instances of crowd cheating really badly, if its individuals they usually get kicked from the venue, if its on a larger scale, there have been events where minimap and Xray was disabled in the arena.", "This has been a thing with in-person events for many, many years. Organizers can do what they can to minimize it by turning off x-ray in person sometimes, noise canceling headphones over IEMs for players, etc, but it’s still going to happen. All pros understand this and expect this. Also, to quote Fl0m, information like that works both ways. \n\n\nSome places are worse, for sure. But there’s only so much you can do. You can also still hear the roar of the crowd with sound proof booths iirc.\n\n\nI hate saying this \nBut “it is what it is.”\n\nI’m open to any suggestions to this problem to solve it, but I’m afraid that it’s just not something that can happen. Collective effervescence is a powerful thing.", "First time watching a major huh lol", "Maybe they can hire some engineers to create a booth that has better noise and vibration insulation from the crowd, and also one way glass that can see in but not out of. I feel like for a information and reading game like CS the pros should be more isolated from crowd cues than they are currently.", "Unfortunately I don't think there is a way to solve it. If you isolate the crowd too much, it will just become a studio LAN for the players.", "I think it's not big enough of an issue for organizers to invest in the engineering required to really isolate pros from crowd, it costs money. But from my view trying to make a really good vibration and noise booth and one way glass can make tournament games much higher quality from competitive integrity standpoint, while the crowd can still be close to the pros and see them through the glass. This probably isn't necessary for games like Dota 2 or League of legends or whatever but for CS, I feel like it's a worth it investment.", "No, in my opinion if I were playing I would take advantage of crowd cues to make slight changes in my gameplay during the round. Valve can be strict for example with coaches not even talking outside of timeouts, in theory they might also be strict about player exposure to crowd during round.", "I've already mentioned it in the other comment - isolating the crowd too much will have a negative impact, turning the event into a studio LAN.\n\nWinning in arena is huge test for teams (look at MOUZ). Some players crumble under the pressure of playing in front of thousands of fans. Some players enjoy riding the energy coming from the crowd.\n\nYes sometimes crowd helps a team, but usually these moments are far and between to cause any major impact on the outcame of matches.", "I don't remember what tournament it was, maybe cologne or something, but pros had a glass that was fogged during the round but would unfog between rounds so the pros can emote to each other. Maybe let the crowd always see into the glass, but the pros can only see out of the glass when the round is not active. Not sure if this technology is available but I would assume it is at this point.\n\n  \nThis would keep the interactive element of the tournament while also helping competitive integrity.", "Blast has done this a few times, but even this is an imperfect solution if your goal is to make it so players get 0 external cues. Xyp9x at one point mentioned in an interview that he could tell that enemies were getting hit by his grenade by the fact that the stage vibrated, since that meant the observers had focused on the players getting hit by the grenade.\n\nObviously we should be fighting against crowd cheating (that being intentional information gain from the crowd, e.g. by having people set up in the crowd to give cues), but the whole point of playing in front of the crowd is the added pressure - if you don't even notice the crowd is there, what's the point of the crowd?  \nAnd the other way too, what's the point of paying good money to be in the crowd if the players are sealed away and may as well be playing in a studio?\n\nWhy would I pay hundreds of bucks to cheer for a team that can't hear, see, or feel me cheer?\n\nFrom a competitive integrity standpoint, duh, we'd have the players locked up in separate rooms with no means of communication with the outside world, but at the end of the day esports isn't just a competition - it's also a product. And a part of the product's appeal is fan interaction, fan participation.\n\nIdk about the viability of having glass be fogged only one way - I feel like it's not doable, because while having the glass be opaque sometimes and transparent other times is very doable, having it be opaque *one way* sometimes and transparent the rest feels like it'd be far more complicated.", "Yes, I understand 100% perfection may be impossible but I think it's not good for them to simply just slap on headphones and call it a day. I think maybe if audio cues are too hard to engineer away, perhaps a visual blocker, say a one way glass that rolls up during rounds and rolls back down between rounds, would at least show an effort that valve is thinking about \\[visual\\] crowd cues that might impact how the round plays.\n\nEdit, I mean, even one single person holding their hand up to their mouth at a specific time can mean the difference between you choosing not to peek this, for example, bomb defusable fake or no fake, or peeking it, or a potential awp angle, or whatever, and so on."]}

{"post_id": "1h5i1hv", "post_title": " Yesterday, moses scolded VP's Jame and electronic for not coming out for a post-match interview. However, Jame did come out for an interview. ", "post_body": "As a VP and, particularly, a Jame fan, I wanted to break these, in my opinion, unfair allegations. I mean, they would be fair had Jame not actually agreed for the interview, but he did, and that fact went over the ears of the English broadcast viewers.\n\nI respect Jame for many things, he's an extremely nice person with a really stoic and calm view on how things work. He's honest and have never been caught lying. He had said that he doesn't come out for the interviews for mainly two reasons: the first is that his English is still not perfect, even though he improved in it; the second is that he doesn't think coming out for an interview without having to say anything in value makes a lot of sense, both for himself and for the viewers who crave the ultimate answer to the everlasting 'what went wrong' and 'who's at fault' questions.\n\n[Post-match interview on the Chinese stream \\(Source: PWRDEsports2 latest VOD @ 9:36:45\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ad3smkr42l4e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fea92144cc30878d6f6d4bd70aea6b3b8c1d5765)\n\nThe interview itself was conducted in Chinese with a Russian translator, so I felt like I owe you all an English translation of it.\n\nInterviewer: It's a pity that you didn't win the match after getting the first map. Can you talk about that with us?\n\nJame: Yes, of course. Yeah.\n\nInterviewer: Can you talk about that? I mean, what are your thoughts currently?\n\nJame: Well, they were simply better than us on Inferno today. They had a better planning, better ideas, we couldn't outaim them in the duels that were favorable for us. It's the same as always, we lost because we were weaker.\n\nInterviewer: In Copenhagen, you reached finals \\[sic\\], but here at the Shanghai Major you're out at this stage already. Is this acceptable for you?\n\nJame: Obviously not. The team has bigger ambitions. We didn't put all this time into practice just to get eliminated at this stage. It is very sad that all your effort doesn't always lead you to success in sport.\n\n[\\\\\"The changes are likely\\\\\" - Jame](https://preview.redd.it/uy1xfs1n4l4e1.png?width=1331&format=png&auto=webp&s=328b3848741a9eee497a9fee201af6dac3ac7d47)\n\nInteviewer: You changed two coaches, do you now plan on changing the tactic?\n\nJame: We still don't know what are we going to do, but the changes are likely. Everything suggests that there will be some. The last season was tough for every player.\n\nInterviewer: Do you miss the Rio Major times? What should it take for you to come back to that state?\n\nJame: You have to dedicate your entire life to this game and hope that the dispersion of the game won't win over you. One day, you'll win.\n\nInterviewer: Will we see you at the next Major?\n\nJame: I hope so. I really hope so. We'll do everything it takes.\n\nI know moses probably didn't know about it, as did many other people here, but Jame never ran away from the interview, as many suggested. I initially myself agreed with moses and thought that it was indeed weird that n0rb3r7 was the one who was selected for the interview at such troubled times, but I feel like we all rushed to the conclusions too quickly.", "post_score": 1203, "post_author": "Masak0vske", "post_created_utc": "2024-12-03 07:26:16", "comment_count": 67, "comments": ["I assume pgl had a side interview off stage? And pw the main interview on stage?", "W post", "At the moment after the game I didn't know Jame was doing an interview with Perfect world for the Chinese stream. We don't have that information or level of communication, and I'll be honest - having the English stream as kind of the secondary/ancillary priority at an event is a new experience especially as we're on the other side of the world. So my fault on that.\n\nThis frustration has been building all year. We've been frequently denied access to certain VP players at events and at times been asked not to discuss VP's leadership situation at all on broadcast. \n\nI want to know the difficulties they are having so I can tell the story and understand why their play has been disappointing, not to point blame at anyone. I want to be able to frame their failures as a result of the difficulties they are going through.. or if they had been more successful frame wins around the obstacles they had to overcome. \n\nThis wasn't in any way personal against either Jame or electronic - I have great respect for the work players put in- or even at VP. I had this same issue with astralis/device/blamef at the last major. The leadership gets credit when they succeed, and should certainly step up when they fail.\n\nRespect to Jame for doing the interview after what had to be a devastating loss and I'll figure out a way to apologize to him when I get the time", "He himself clarified this in a comment in that thread so hopefully he reads this thread well", "It just looks unfortunate Moses wasn't told/aware that Jame was doing one on stage\n\nTo back up moses a little. VP usually have n0rb3r7 do the interviews a lot. \n\nelectroNic english is fine, he's the other big name on the team", "After last Major's incident that happened with Jame and how he handled it, I don't think we criticise his personality. He doesn't shy away from responsibility and doesn't blame others for their loss. He earned a lot of respect from the community and Moses critising him without actually researching is bad on his part.", "And of course, a post like this will only get a fraction of attention compared to the one where Jame was flamed", "Like I said in the other thread about it, I do agree with Moses that leaders should show leadership, but there could be many explanations why Jame wasn't there. Language barrier being one of them, and then of course this, that he was simply busy elsewhere. \n\nThanks for the translation. Always good to hear from Jame.", "This is not gonna get noticed enough because it's cool to hate on Jame and VP", "Thank you for the post, Jame is still amazing after all! Yesterday I was very confused about not seeing him in the interview but it actually makes sense. Well done sir", "This is like the opposite of misinformation, plusinformation", "He'll come back strong.", "Moses isn't very friendly to those penis' he isn't sucking on", "So I guess it was entitlement from Moses?", "Alright time to SLAM moses, who's with me :^)", "Man these interviews are worthless.\n\n\"Why did you lose?\"\n\"They played better\"\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\"Keep trying to be better\"\n\nYeah thanks for the insight", "Good on Jame for speaking after the loss, but the responsibility of a leader should be to take the tough interviews - be it him or electronic - to speak to where the team is at after a loss like this. These guys are the leaders of the team and their most experienced players but we barely hear from them. \n\nDoing the softball interview in front of the Chinese crowd where your words are being translated is a cop out vs talking to the official broadcast where the vast majority of fans and the media are tuning in.", "Who cares, the team is dead either way.", "He said it just straight out after norbert's interview, how is he supposed to know that jame will also give an interview after", "Yes, that was what happened. Jame immediately came out on stage in front of the Chinese fans and spoke with the host, n0rb3r7 was taken backstage by James Banks and interviewed there for the English broadcast. I assume this was done by Perfect World because Chinese fans would obviously be more excited to see Jame speak to them, PGL had no choice but to grab n0rb3r7 and have him speak out."]}
