he had so many whiffs and just looks fucking lost, in the last month his rating has been lower than karrigans", "I would like to apologize to my fellow FaZe fans for my comment yesterday that if broky woke up, we may have a chance for finals. I was unaware him beginning to wake up meant siphoning the entire life force from the rest of the team.", "Oh I was not expecting a stomp AT ALL", "dam faze did not show up at all in this series", "My pickems hanging on by the thinnest of threads.", "Was Faze in the room with us today?", "Last time i watched Snax in major playoffs was in arena in Kraków, 2017. Life moves pretty fast.", "I was totally prepared for Faze to lose this matchup since yesterday, but I wasn't expecting them to lose in such a embarassing way. Even a T2 team would've make G2 break a sweat for this win.", "I knew faze won't do me dirty and qualify to playoffs without hassle.  Of course I have to go through an another nail biting B03. \n\nThx faze top work m8s", "Gentleman, are we cooked?", "faze might want to do some warmups before the actual game instead of during the game", "I have never seen a more dead team performance", "Well. That was terrible.", "Faze has no firepower at all", "7 rounds LOL\n\nfaze just love losing against pistols this team are so fucking pathetic.", "wtf was that???", "The comms seem to be especially bad for Faze in mirage, in that last round, 2 seconds after ropz died to malbs in a main there was no communication at all, broky was looking at conn and died to malbs again"]}

Just saw NiKo in the match vs. Faze try to bait a reaction from the crowd in Round 3 Inferno, 1v1 vs Frozen.

Many players have done this and it defo cuts both ways unless there is a biased crowd. The most impressive example of this in recent times was Vita vs G2 in the finals of IEM Dallas. Even though G2 had home crowd support, in one post plant situation Apex commed to Mezzi to hold the defuse until the crowd noise and then to peek the T to bait them. Pro players, especially IGLs, have often stated that some strats can't be called on LAN because of crowd noise. The best example of this was round 29 Navi vs Faze in map 5 (Nuke) Cologne 2022 finals where Twistzz got the drop on Electronic as he couldn't hear Twistzz drop from silo. Even though what happened to Tabsen yesterday was unfortunate, I'd say that having a crowd is an integral part of t1 cs. Before ppl say that TOs get soundproof booths like in dota, pros have said that they can still hear/feel the crowd vibrations and it isn't practical from an financial perspective.", "If it's allowed then its ok", "It’s just part of a live match, to be expected", "The crowd will always give signals whether pros bait for it or not. It’s fair game considering any pro can do it, and it’s not considered between pros to be a terrible thing to do, no “gentleman’s agreement” against it or something. Is what it is when it’s a LAN environment", "It’s LAN experience. Part of winning the major, or anything, is to overcome the stress from crowds. Adapt it or leave it. Or don’t whine if one day all pro matches are being played in bubble just like covid times", "If the Teams and Players *Really Really Really* wanted for Crowd sounds giving away plays to not happen, they'd have pushed event organizers for 100% Sound Isolation solutions.\n\nThis isn't a thing because Players & Teams themselves don't consider it a high-priority issue. They're fine with it (outside of the 20 seconds after it happens to them of course).", "Fair game given its a live match. You got to use whatever advantage you can to your benefit if it means winning the game/tournament.", "It’s part of the game and within this lan environment totally fine, even expected", "It's awful but most people don't mind it so nothing you can do.", "Its definitely scummy but so many players do it that they kinda have to, as well as its unavoidable to an extent unless you somehow get the crowd to be completely silent. It can also be a disadvantage if the crowds reacting to player A but player B thinks theyre the one about to get in a fight and so gives away their position, which i think happened yesterday on ancient in the mongols heroic match."]}
