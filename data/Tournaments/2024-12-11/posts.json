With four faceit stars acting as the fingers of his hand, he won a major and earned event MVP. The other great IGLs of this era that won a major (karrigan, aleksib, apex) had far less individual impact, and far more talent on the roster. We can make jokes all day about Jame being slow or boring, but the magnitude of leading his squad to a major title in Rio, cannot be overstated. Add to this the run VP had as a top 10 team. Jame is elite.\n\nVP will not be able to recover from this. They have no pieces worth building around. Players that can be part of a successful roster, yes. But championship teams are always built around superstar talents, and VP just benched theirs.\n\nAs a fan, I hope Jame goes to Spirit. He can IGL, anchor, secondary AWP, and clutch.
