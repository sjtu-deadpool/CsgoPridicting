Unfortunately, no matter how much I am \"active on the forum\", HLTV denies me opportunities to post on their forum page. So this post is gonna go here!\n\nThe Chinese stream has 3 mil+ viewers, to be exact.\n\nBilibili is the primary video streaming site in China, the equivalent to a combination of YouTube and Twitch. The current livestream for the major, as of the date of this forum post, is covering the advancement match between MOUZ and mibr. Obviously a high-stakes matchup, but I'm sure most would agree that it isn't exactly an S-tier match that you'll drop everything to watch.\n\nThe current livestream on bilibili that's covering the ShangHai Major is, as of typing this sentence, sitting at nearly 3.5 million viewers.\n\nThe Chinese character in the viewer count means \"10,000\", and when preceded by a 300+ number, that means the viewer count is in the multi-millions.\n\nThat is an absolutely absurd number to digest. For an elimination stage match, where its primary viewers are essentially coming from a single country rather than multiple continents.\n\nHow about instead of complaining endlessly over the stream schedules, we appreciate that after over a DECADE, and TWENTY majors later, that the Asian counter-strike fans can finally have a major that fits their time zone? One in twenty majors that takes place in a different time zone that accommodates a less-represented CS region should be absolutely nothing to complain about.\n\nWe all love CS esports to death. It should be our goal to SHARE and spread that love to ALL regions of the world. After all, if anyone's missing out on the history, glory, and brevity of this game's esports scene, they're missing out on something truly incredible.\n\nAs an Asian-American fan of the CS esports scene, who regularly watches CS streams after they've run regardless because I have responsibilities outside of my favorite sport, this major has been an absolutely perfect concoction of everything I could ask for. I cannot wait to see who gets crowned champion on Sunday.\n\nEDIT 1 - I would like to specify that I am an ABC in particular. American Born Chinese. Just in case anyone in particular wonders why an American would be so excited about a Chinese-dubbed stream of the CS2 major.\n\nEDIT 2 - As of typing this sentence, in the mibr vs MOUZ match, the winner of map 1 is currently sitting on map point on map 2.
