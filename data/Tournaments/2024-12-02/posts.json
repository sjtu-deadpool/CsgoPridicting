Harry and Hugo (And Machine/SpunJ+all the other lovely CS casters) I love you.", "i may be the biggest rigon defender on this website but if i ever see him playing B on dust 2 again i may need a new monitor. maybe im being reactive, furia looked so crisp on map 3 and they obviously focused B so hard¬†\n\n¬†just like in bne, his consistency is his biggest flaw and i hate it because when he‚Äôs switched on he‚Äôs so lethal and fun to watch. but these lows are soooo tough. ¬† ¬†¬†\n\nim hoping its just growing pains like iM for navi. at least he looked sexy on nuke", "cannot believe that this skullz was being scapegoated so badly by Liquid, what an insane pickup for FURIA", "skullz glow up has been nice to watch on furia. i think people in this era of international teams can overlook how native language comms and teammates can make a lot of difference for some players. he just looks so much more comfortable. \n\nvintage fallen performance on mirage (before they started throwing) and dust 2 too, both calling and fragging. not as consistent as before these days, but when he does show up you can really feel the impact he has on the server.", "Fallen advancing at the major is always fun to watch\n\nDude was awping like the old days and then calling on dust2 like he‚Äôs seen everything everywhere on that map and constantly inside tabsen‚Äôs head \n\nAlso fuck yeah skullz! Dude has some insane aim", "Furia and mibr should try planting a few seconds before the end of the round rather than after imo", "I've never seen BIG get more thoroughly dismantled on dust than this. It seemed like Furia had the playbook next to them. They punished BIG for trusting rigoN on b and as soon as they made adjustments, made them overthink them by putting on a pressure. Currently rigoN is costing this team is too many rounds and its really a shame. i think playing mirage and dust vs furia gave them an opening on more puggy maps. Part of me wants to say they were probably exhausted after mirage (which they should have brought to OT) but the dust was so bad man", "Classic BIG performance 10/10", "FALLEN WON AGAINST BIG? WHAT!? HOW? I THIS A DREAM????", "Super entertaining game, tabseN cooked with some calls on nuke but then Fallen was completely in BIG's heads the other two maps, with some strong mental to come back after the disaster that was map 1\n\nVery much recommend watching this bo3 if you're checking this thread later on, it had it all: from scrappy rounds to amazing reads with perfect util usage to unbelievable round wins", "Rigon is not an anchor", "Skullz was straight bullying that b bombsite on dust2", "young up and coming talent *checks notes* Fallen ???", "I can't tell if FURIA is decent or bad.", "First half map 2 and all of map 3 is the type of Furia i want more of!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Rare day off from Kscerato but GG.", "I did not watch map 1 so I'm kinda biased here but BIG's T sides calling is so \"simplistic\" that Furia had the read on at all times. That being said Furia's form doesn't really inspire confidence for the elim stage"]}
