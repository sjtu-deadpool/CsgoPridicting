And HeavyGod's a solid piece as well, helps that he's basically a NAF/Twistzz-like player, being able to what the team needs to do and can play both passively or aggressively. ICY's also fine and has been very impactful at times but if there's a possibility that m0NESY has been secured, there's unfortunately no other choice.\n\nC9's major issues are just a shit coach (and lack of in general due to only having groove) and interz being a decoy most of the time.\n\nBut this entirely depends on what m0NESY wants to do post-Shanghai which no one has a genuine clue on what happens with him, people just assuming he follows NiKo again."]}
