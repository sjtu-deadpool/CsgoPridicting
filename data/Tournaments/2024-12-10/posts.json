It's just a category distinction and categories can & do exist for all sorts of things. Food, eSports, memes, casual talk, Travel, Li Ziqi type content, etc etc. This is trivial for online platforms to integrate in their access/interaction flow. \n\nThe actual answer is in simple terms, \"*Proprietary Data*\".\n\n> This metric (Heat Score) includes several variables, and no one, except the developers themselves, can name their exact number.\n\nChinese platforms simply do not share publicly that **1** vector (Concurrent Live Spectators) in this Heat Score equation is & what its weightage is in that equation.\n\nChinese internet scene is ruthless competition and this sort of data in many cases has competitive edge cases for their businesses.\n\nThough companies that partner with them may & likely will have access to this data, broken down by individual vectors. Valve possibly does have these numbers (actual CS scene estimate in China).  \n\nAdditionally this sort of data breakdown & news announcement about it by the Platforms on certain ocassions/events is likely present/discussed on Chinese internet. We just aren't privy to that because of the Language barrier in accessing their Internet space.\n\nChinese Internet scene isn't some backwater, it's at the leading edge of where this domain is. It indeed has massive scale, we're just haggling over how massive, which for CS events like Majors becomes, is it 4 Million Chinese watching or is it 1.5 Million.\n\nBecause for sure as hell it ain't like 50,000. That simply doesn't work and pass the smell test. \n\nAs for this post. Pre-2024 PW Majors and this Major's viewership for RoW+Asian combined tally is likely going to see an increase. \n\nThis would be a simply function of statistical scale. Asia is much bigger and bulk of it is sleeping when other Majors in Europe/NA happen. Meaning the degree by which numbers will rise in Asia will be massively higher in relative terms than the degree by which it can fall in Europe & NA due to raw underlying scale.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantCompetitive/s/OdTaPgqsUo\n\nI take that back. 1.4 million viewers for a timezone terrible for the west EXCLUDING Chinese viewership.
