It's just a category distinction and categories can & do exist for all sorts of things.

Valve possibly does have these numbers (actual CS scene estimate in China).  \n\nAdditionally this sort of data breakdown & news announcement about it by the Platforms on certain ocassions/events is likely present/discussed on Chinese internet. We just aren't privy to that because of the Language barrier in accessing their Internet space.\n\nChinese Internet scene isn't some backwater, it's at the leading edge of where this domain is.

That simply doesn't work and pass the smell test. \n\nAs for this post. Pre-2024 PW Majors and this Major's viewership for RoW+Asian combined tally is likely going to see an increase. \n\nThis would be a simply function of statistical scale. Asia is much bigger and bulk of it is sleeping when other Majors in Europe/NA happen.
