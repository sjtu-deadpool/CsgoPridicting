When Chopper is hitting shots like he was midway through Dust 2 you know Spirit's opponents are in massive trouble. \n\nFor Spirit, I think they are underrated going into these playoffs. Listening to the panel you could forget they're one of the top teams and dangerous to anyone (apart from G2). Their RMR was messy but their play wasn't as bad as being described - they lost a Bo1 then got Buchholz'd into a nightmare draw with G2 and the decider but they handled those extra matches very cleanly. They're always going to be fragile because their IGL is not top tier and Zontix is prone to a poor game, but they've got a real good shot now.\n\nFor Liquid - this is about the level they're going to achieve with the talent on their side. Having your IGL also being your best player is a tough spot. It puts tons on Twistzz's back. The panel ridiculously over hyping them makes the loss feel worse but they have consistently struggled to put away top teams. They need a star to replace Yekindar and they get added to the list of NA teams who should be kicking themselves for missing out on MalbsMD.", "Liquid got donked", "yekindar's trying his best to sabotage twistzz's valiant effort lmfao."]}
