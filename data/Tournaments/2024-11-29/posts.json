I found some solutions on the internet but most of them required additional software (like Python or some other runtime) to use. Then I realized that it wasn't really that challenging to implement and I went to work. The entire program is a single executable that will just run out of the box after downloading\\*.\n\nThe project is entirely open source and can be found here:  \n[https://github.com/michihupf/cs2-acceptor](https://github.com/michihupf/cs2-acceptor)\n\nI appreciate any feedback, bug reports and feature suggestions -- but I won't include features that run while in a match -- in my opinion that is cheating. This is also the reason why the killswitch button for the program is on the \\[B\\]-key as if you forget to close it, it will close when you first open the buy menu.  \nI also will (probably) not add any features that use the internet as this tool doesn't really need it /except maybe automatic updates if that is requested.\n\n\\*: As of now Linux and MacOS users need to compile the tool from source.", "post_score": 0, "post_author": "norysq", "post_created_utc": "2024-11-29 21:05:31", "comment_count": 14, "comments": ["excellent, can't wait to have even more people on my team that are afk for the first 2 rounds of the game", "Yeah, not really a fan of this for CS2. I could kinda get behind it for CSGO, where you'd often have multi-minute warmups, but for CS2 you should just be on your PC when you are searching for a match. Most of the time the game will start within 30sec of you accepting, so there really isn't any excuse for why you can't do whatever you have to do *before* you start queuing. \n\nWe already have enough idiots afk the pistol round, we don't need an automated tool to make that even more common.\n\nI think it's cool that you took the time to develop something to help other players, but I think in this case, it just encourages *exactly* the wrong behavior.", "Oh no my skins are gone!!Â ", "Make it send you a notification to the phone, then unintentional afks will be less of a problemÂ ", "> *: As of now Linux and MacOS users need to compile the tool from source.\n\nCS2 doesn't even have MacOS capabilities.

That will activate the technical timeout and will even punish the afk player if they don't come back", "Ok that made me chuckle xD", "That will require a phone app as well, I am not quite sure if it is worth it seeing as the app will probably be 10x more code than the actual program", "Oh well in that case only Linux users thanks for that info. Did not know that", "you could consider using an existing app, and just have it send a message (or a notification speciffically), not saying it is worth it, but it's 'a way' to bring it futher :)", "I will do some research and see. I am not really a fan of giving this tool internet access but a feature like this could make it better. Thank you for the feedback :D", "After doing some research I could not find any app that would allow me to send push notifications linked to the app"]}
