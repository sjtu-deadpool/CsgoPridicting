What I'll say is that the supreme utility usage that made Astralis so superior back in the day is now the standard among top teams. There are several teams that I'd say have more firepower than Astralis did back then (Spirit, Vitality, G2) - but we know firepower is not all that matters (NaVi). So if I had to guess I'd say prime Astralis would still be a top team, but not dominant.", "Astralis were so far ahead of other teams in decision making that it made everyone change how they approach util, I think they're never going to be discredited by the next generation", "From the LG/SK era onward the established #1 ranked teams would trade blows with them. Prior to that the teams didnt have proper structured play.", "Feels like no one has even come close to prime Astralis. Their decision making, their synergy, their teamwork was topnotch and I think teams now don't have play the same as they used to -- which is why some analysts believe the quality of CS has downgraded since 2019\n\nThough, I think many would agree that firepower these days have significantly improved compared to before. A Tier 1 team could lose to a well-prepared tier 2.5 team just by virtue of difference in firepower.", "No team has come close to peak astralis other than 2021 navi that won the major. Both teams would body the current competition.", "I agree, but specifically do you believe that the standard has caught up?\n\nUsing prime-Fnatic as an example, it was also extremely scary to play against them. Their aggressive play style and raw ability was unmatched, and very few teams *relative to the competition in that team’s time* has been as dominant as them. Yet if we send most top teams back in time, Fnatic would look much less strong. Would you say this does not apply to Astralis, even in a smaller sense?", "Interesting, def what I was looking for. Thank you! My main takeaway from my catch-up is that the firepower is extreme, so much talent nowadays.", "the utility usage peak was just before they went on a rampage. people kinda started catching up to the way astralis was using util. Astralis had multiple peaks ( or what it felt like at the time) before they got to their prime. Prime astralis just worked like a very well oiled machine. Back when augs and kreigs were a thing these dudes held hard to clear angles at chest levels instead of head and this was literally the only team thinking like that. I remember casters throwing around questions like what would ur dream team be and pros would literally go like - current astralis AND IT WASN'T for the team chemistry.", "LG/SK were pretty dominant too", ">do you believe that the standard has caught up?\n\nI recently rewatched parts of the Cologne IGLs roundtable from earlier this year and all three of them (Aleksib, karrigan, apEX) seemed to agree that this is the case. They were saying that back then only Astralis were playing the sort of calculated, detailed CS that is more or less required from all top teams nowadays.", "if Astralis were together today they would for sure be top 3, consistancy was their main strength, their floor would be able to take down most teams in bo3's. I'd say the current G2/Navi playing their best could probably take them down", "We're doing better now, but during the online era and the time after it the level across the board dropped significantly. When people say it wasn't close it really wasn't. Teams were missing util, not checking corners or playing together, trading was bad, teams were going to events with incomplete rosters or making changes right before important events. Even if they weren't then they wouldn't have been able to touch prime astralis. \n\nWe definitely have a better skill level across the top teams at the moment, it's nice to actually be watching some good CS this week.", "I was there in the SK era, and Astralis went far beyond their level.", "Not even close.", "Exactly. Can't remember which Astralis player/coach interview was it, but they attributed their success to being the first team to go deeper into analytics with heat maps, studying tendencies and using utility accordingly. Much of what all top teams are doing nowadays.", "Yes, but people just assume that because teams learnt from Astralis then they'd be as good and that modern teams have built upon and improved on what Astralis did.\n\nI could attend Einsteins lectures, that wouldn't make me a scientist.", "I hear you but I’m not sure about the analogy. Not into physics but I’d say any maths graduate student knows better calculus than Newton/Leibniz for example, which is the kind of “inflation” I’m referencing."]}
