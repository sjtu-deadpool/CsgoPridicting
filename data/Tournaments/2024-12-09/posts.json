And BLAST has to use Valve Rankings from December 2nd for invites.\n\nAnd the only other method that they could've used is too restrictive at the moment (wildcard invites) as it only applies to teams that won a tier 1 event (MOUZ, G2, FaZe, NAVI, Spirit, and Vitality) or have a core of players that were originally and individually from teams ranked top 8 in Valve Rankings at any point in the past 12 months.\n\nIf you want an example, lets say Falcons and Cloud9 want to swipe a wildcard invite (both are eligible as they were ranked top 8 in early 2024 and are one step away from eligibility.). Falcons currently has Magisk and soon NiKo while Cloud9 has Boombl4 and Ax1Le. Both teams would need to acquire one more player that fulfills the requirement to be eligible, in which Falcons could hypothetically bring back SunPayus while C9 needs to acquire a player as Perfecto has no intention of returning. But because they're a Russian-speaking team, they're restricted to only players from VP, Spirit, or m0NESY.", "solid move", "Ah shit, didn't realize the cutoff was December 2nd. If it were later they would squeak into the top 32 since the fe teams wouldn't be attending. Makes sense, hopefully we see them get time in Europe in the future.", "Isn't the cutoff the [16th](https://blast.tv/cs/news/BLAST-premier-updated-format) even then they wouldn't be close enough because its the top 28 with another 4 from wildcards for the 32 total", "depends on how it looks, if they hold onto their top 40 Valve Rankings, they should be getting an auto invite to PGL Buenos Aires. But unfortunately that's also very close to EPL 21 so if they were to attend Buenos Aires, they have no time to rest and have to fly immediately to wherever in EU EPL 21 will be held in.", "well we'll see whether or not BLAST actually uses the wildcard invites. I wouldn't be surprised to see one used for Falcons assuming they sign all the top players they're hoping to over the break, but I'm not sure they'll be any other teams that'll be eligible for a wildcard invite.", "Thats a risk they are going to have to take tbh. they need to continue to get as many pts. daps said something about a european bootcamp so my guess is they go to PGL then straight to proleague and then bootcamp there", "Where are you sourcing this information? I'd like to check it out for myself, curious how this all works."]}
