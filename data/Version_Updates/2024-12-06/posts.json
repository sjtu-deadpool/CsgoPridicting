He has always had a bit of a longevity issue, he does his best work when he has a new player (or players).

But once he's somewhat defined that meta, his team dips.\n\nReplacing broky might give faze new life, especially since it gives Karrigan a new awp to play around with.  I don't know how long it would last though.", "They had enough of the time to perform, they've been with frozen for a full year at this point. They HAVE to change out someone in this roster if they want to hang with the best.
