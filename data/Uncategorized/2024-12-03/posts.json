For the second image, NAVI and Vitality straight up can't meet majority of the time. **So if you want to have NAVI and Vitality to avoid meeting each other in the 2-0, you essentially need to pray Mongolz beats G2 tomorrow night.

I always play with 2 friends, we have around 75 games, Player B joint after Player A and C played like 6 games in Premier. so for the last 70 games we always played as a group of 3. nevertheless our ratings are now 600 points apart. 10 games ago our ratings were about\n\nPlayer A:\\~2700\n\nPlayer B:\\~2300\n\nPlayer C:\\~2100\n\nAs I understand Elo, the gap between us should actually get smaller and not bigger over time. We play every game together, so there should be no differences due to winning streaks or losing streaks and if there is a skill factor, the ranking is not correct either. I've added up ADR and HTLV rating for the last 10 games\n\nPlayer A: ADR: 103.9 HLTV: 1.419\n\nPlayer B: ADR: 50 HLTV: 0.862\n\nPlayer C: ADR: 86.4 HLTV: 1.215\n\nthis shows that player C is actually performing better than player B and yet the rating has changed in the last 10 games (50% win rate) as follows\n\nPlayer A: -90\n\nPlayer B: -84\n\nPlayer C: -103\n\nI just don't understand it, normally the player with the highest rating should lose the most points and not the one with the lowest rating.
