I’m really nervous because I’ve been unable to figure out the issue for months.\n\nTo clarify a few things upfront:\n\n I’m not one of those players who screams, cries while gaming, or complains about being bad at the game. I’ve played CS 1.6 for a long time, CS:GO since 2019, and CS2 since its release. I play for several hours daily and can’t shake the feeling that something isn’t right. What’s going on?\n\nEvery time, I lose duels and it’s absolutely abnormal. Every time there’s a new update, the game seems to run worse for me. I feel like the game is choking in some way. When I engage in duels, my mouse feels off, like it doesn’t glide smoothly in those moments. It’s way too hard to land a kill, and I constantly feel like I’m playing at 60Hz. There’s this persistent feeling that everyone else is faster than me,they’re running, shooting, and aiming with insane precision. I hope you understand what I’m trying to describe. I literally have nothing on my PC, just CS2 and a couple of picture folders.\n\nI’ll attach my CS2 settings, PC specs, and NVIDIA settings.\n\nIf anyone knows anything or can help me out, I’d be really grateful.\n\nP.S. I’ve had numerous optimizations done by different people—some helped temporarily (but then things reverted), and some didn’t help at all.\n\nThanks! \n\nPc spec : \n\nMother board : rog crosshair x670e\n\nProcessor : amd ryzen 9 7950x\n\nGpu : nvidia geforce rtx 4070ti gigabyte\n\nRam : kingston fury 2x16 6000mghz ddr5\n\npower supply : corsair rm 1000x\n\nwater cooling : nzxt ", "post_score": 0, "post_author": "NeDuRa1995", "post_created_utc": "2024-12-01 22:56:10", "comment_count": 10}
