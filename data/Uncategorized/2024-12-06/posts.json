This is reminiscent of Vitality winning in Paris, but somehow to me it's even bigger.\n\nComing from Asia I used to play with/against the first few players that eventually formed The Mongolz. Competing for a living was a pipe dream back then for asian players. Absolutely impossible considering the lack of sponsors, lack of pro experience, support from family (lol). We had to self organize and host local tournaments to keep the CS scene alive. \n\nOn top of that add the heavy investments from EU/NA orgs compared to Asian orgs. Not only did the MongolZ stay relevant, they set their sights and achieved playoffs on a legit run at the first ever Asian major. This was unimaginable before The MongolZ and the gravity of their cultural impact is going to be massive.\n\nEvery top team faltered due to nerves/lack of prac, etc. The top players in race for #1 are not showing up on key maps. Imagine the mountain of pressure on a home team in the first major (and probably only Asian one for a while). Mongolz still gave it their all and played inspired CS. Go for the win!\n\nCherry on top while watching the exciting advancement match against Heroic was partly due to the excellent CS talent that we have. Couldn't have asked for more as an Asian fan for launders to cast the winning match, bleh building  the storylines. Also thanks scrawny for an epic winning moment commentary.
