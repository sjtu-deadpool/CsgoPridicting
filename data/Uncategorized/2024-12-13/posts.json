It would be a cool narrative going full circle from the event that started this year to the one that finished it.\n2. I like that Karrigan and Donk are basically complete opposites: A winner nearing the end of his career and a prodigy just beginning it. Whoever wins will build their legacy off of the corpse of the other\n3. It would be a great way to truly show the parity of this year in elite tournaments. \nSpirit wins Katowice, Vitality wins Cologne, Navi wins the major, and Faze wins the one at the end. Faze was in the running at the beginning of the year to be the best team in the world, if you count all their finals and how consistent they were, if they get the major + chengdu they still can't be the team of the year as Na'Vi has that locked down imo but it would still be a year where the best team only won like 3 more events than the next five. \n\n4. I've a massive Karrigan fan but even I feel like I can't call him the GOAT IGL until the has at least 2 majors. I think in terms of skill at the role he's better than Gla1ve, but this would be the last piece in his resume that just shows it. \n\n\n\nObviously it will be cool no matter who wins at this point. Donk could solidify the GOAT rookie year, Mouz could shed their choker status and all become champions before the teams splits up, FaZe's legacy solidified in more ways than one, Niko and M0nesy winning a major together before they potentially split would also be great (as well as Malbs getting one so early what?), but either way this is a great major playoffs and I truly love this game.

Same thing for offline maps, the Yprac maps were perfect because there were several options for each map, now all of them are outdated or any \"replacements\" are just crappy pre-fire courses. Besides payment sites like Refrag an such, are there any other options anymore?", "post_score": 1, "post_author": "xWolvez", "post_created_utc": "2024-12-13 00:46:13", "comment_count": 2}
