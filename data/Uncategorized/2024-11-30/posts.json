Fair warning: it might trigger some of you—but hear me out.\n\nBack in 2013, I bought CS:GO on my main account. I was just a 13-year-old kid with zero gaming skills and a severe case of stupidity. So, what did I do? I cheated. Five games in, boom—VAC banned. Lesson learned, right? (Yeah, I know. Dumb move, but we grow.)\n\nFast forward to 2021. I hadn’t touched CS-like games since then—none of that strafing, spraying, or “aim god” mechanics. Instead, I was into mil-sim games, where patience and realism take center stage. But I got curious and decided to try Valorant. Played for about a year, hit Platinum, then eventually dropped it.\n\nNow we’re in 2024. I bit the bullet, created a new account, and bought CS2 to see what I’d been missing. And let me tell you—it’s fantastic. Way better than Valorant, which feels like a CS clone with extra fluff.\n\nOver the past five years, I’ve heard so much about CS from my roommate, who’s an ex-semi-pro. He’s been my unofficial coach, giving me tips on lineups, positioning, and how not to suck.\n\n**The Problem?**  \nThe game is great—it’s fast, thrilling, and exactly what I wanted. But there’s one glaring issue: *cheaters*. In almost every game, there’s at least one dude toggling hacks on and off. It’s a buzzkill. My roommate suggested I try Faceit for a cleaner experience, but I’ve also heard good things about Premier.\n\n**So, Here’s My Dilemma:**  \nWhich one should I commit to—Faceit or Premier? I’m still new to CS mechanics, apart from my time in Valorant. I’m looking for a place to learn and improve without constantly running into cheaters.\n\n**What I’d Like to Know:**\n\n1. Which platform is better for a relatively new player?\n2. Any tips for avoiding cheaters and keeping the game enjoyable?\n3. What should I focus on as a beginner in CS?\n\nHonestly, I just want to give this game a proper chance and make up for my past mistakes. Thanks in advance for any advice, and feel free to roast me for being a dumb kid back in the day—I’ve earned it.", "post_score": 0, "post_author": "Haorelian", "post_created_utc": "2024-11-30 20:19:05", "comment_count": 12}
