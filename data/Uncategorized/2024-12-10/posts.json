{"post_id": "1hb2unz", "post_title": "Easiest Quarterfinal Predictions Ever", "post_body": "**Disclaimer:** I enjoy the different dynamics and aspects of all teams in the playoffs and what they've brought to the table this year. I'm completely neutral except for one team, which is Spirit, which I'm definitely more of a fan of than the others.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith that said, the quarters this time are surprisingly easy to predict despite some of the discourse around it seemingly being not the case. Here's what's gonna happen:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n### **MOUZ vs MongolZ:**\n\nWinner: **Mouz**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* MongolZ is not a Top 5 Team. Never been in a single T1 Playoffs the whole year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* MOUZ should have won 8/10 times the b01 that they lost.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* MongolZ being favorites due to being in China is a slightly fake narrative. Hell, MOUZ choking/underperforming while under pressure is a bigger thing to look towards if MongolZ is to win. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* The B03 that they won to advance to the Playoffs was against HEROIC, a team they had just beat in Thunderpick. HEROIC's in a good form, but they're still on the bottom half of teams going into playoffs, at least on paper. Regarding their recent match up, there could be an element of MongolZ just matching up well against HEROIC, and even if that's the case... at end of the day, they're just two B03's against an outside Top 5 team, at times outside top 10 team, so it's hard to judge how they will fare against a real, consistent top 5 team, which MOUZ certainly has been this year. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* I picture it like this: What's more likely? MongolZ keeps their hot streak form to beat a Top 5 team in MouZ in a b03 (Which is still a hard thing to do even with their form), where they should have lost the b01 before even in their hot form... or MongolZ just simply revert to the form they've had all year long - one of being a Great team, but not an Elite team. All rationale points towards the latter.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Slightly rooting for MongolZ to win.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---  \n\n### **Spirit vs Liquid:**\n\nWinner: **Spirit**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Liquid had easy opponents in their 3-1 run, playing GamerLegion and the NA RMR. They still dropped a map to MIBR. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Liquid barely won a limping, 'all except donk' underfperforming Spirit at Fall Final. Who on Liquid is currently realistically standing up to Spirit's stars? \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Liquid has had a solid YEKINDAR this tournament. Even if he keeps the uptick in his performance, I *still* can't see them winning current Spirit. Even if just one of the supporting Spirit cast decides not to disappear, there's no reality where Liquid wins.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* [EU (Yes, CIS) vs \"NA\"... Come on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O53hM8smids)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Rooting for Spirit\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n### **FaZe vs Vitality:**\n\nWinner: **Vitality**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* What's there to even say? Can FaZe ~~Bulls~~ Magic beat in form Vitality, where even support players like Mezii are popping off? \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Vitality had an easy run, yet even an overrated Vitality dropping back to reality or even underperforming a lot still seems like an impossible force to overcome for the current FaZe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Rooting for FaZe\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n### **G2 vs HEROIC**\n\nWinner: **G2**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Too much firepower on G2. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Too much at stake for NiKo and m0NESY to lose. Not in quarters at least, and certainly not to HEROIC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Personally, I believe this to be the hardest match to predict, not in terms of how close the two teams should be, but how it will go down in reality. I do believe G2 *should* take this down comfortably if they are to win the Major, but if there's one match that doesn't go the way I've outlined - it's this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Ever so slightly rooting for G2\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLink this truth after Friday - It's just how it's gonna be!", "post_score": 3, "post_author": "TryQuality", "post_created_utc": "2024-12-10 14:22:39", "comment_count": 9}
