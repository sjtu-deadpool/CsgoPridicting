Based on the win streak that MongolZ has had recently, I favor MongolZ to take the series.\n* **Spirit vs Liquid**: Spirit is heavily favored here. Given their consistent form and recent performances, they should overcome Liquid.\n* **G2 vs Heroic**: G2 is the clear favorite in this matchup. With Niko in peak form and G2‚Äôs overall roster cohesion, they should emerge victorious. Niko's drive for his first Major title adds an additional motivational layer, likely pushing G2 to a win.\n* **Vitality vs FaZe**: Vitality's recent performances, particularly during the playoffs, solidify their advantage over FaZe. Vitality's consistency and individual form should secure them the victory.\n* **MongolZ vs Spirit**: MongolZ has yet to secure significant victories against top-tier teams in a BO3 format. While their strong run in the Major is noteworthy, the series of close games they've had indicates they may struggle against Spirit. Spirit‚Äôs recent victories and overall form give them the upper hand here. Their victory over MongolZ in ESL Pro League Season 20 further supports the expectation that they will emerge as the winners if they maintain their current level of play.\n* **G2 vs Vitality**: This is the most challenging series to call, with both teams performing at a high level. However, G2's hunger, driven by Niko's pursuit of his first Major title, may just give them the edge in a 2-1 series. Expect this to be a highly competitive and intense matchup.\n* **Finals ‚Äì Spirit vs G2**: In the final, G2, bolstered by Niko's determination, is poised to claim their first Major victory. While Spirit‚Äôs form is strong, G2‚Äôs firepower, tactical depth, and Niko‚Äôs leadership should lead them to a 2-1 victory in what will be a close final.\n\nTo note, my predictions so far have been reasonably accurate: 6/10 in the opening stage and 7/10 in the elimination stage.\n\nWould be interested to hear your thoughts on these predictions!", "post_score": 0, "post_author": "Friendly_Bass6588", "post_created_utc": "2024-12-11 05:51:36", "comment_count": 16}
