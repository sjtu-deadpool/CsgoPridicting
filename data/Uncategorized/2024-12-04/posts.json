Some suggestions below.\n\n\nContext:\nNot everyone has access to the game all the time. Though being an adult with responsibilities sucks, we can't avoid it.\n\nI can't speak for others but I am sharing my experience. If it is a \"me\" problem, I will suck it up and live with it. \nI am a long time player and huge fan of the e-Sport scene. I love Pick'Ems and want to support the teams. This week I have to travel for work and now I am in a situation where I cannot make my picks for the next stage. When I get back, I most likely won't do the next stage, my motivation is not there. If this is how it is going to be, I am not willing to buy a pass next time. \nWhy: because I can't participate, why should I pay? If I sucked and made wrong picks, I don't mind. \n\nSuggestions:\n1. Webapp is the obvious one. I think there was a community based one that I am not sure worked, for sure it doesn't work now.\n\n I can understand that you don't want people logging on to a website that can be spoofed and open up a new attack vector. Thus the following suggestions:\n\n2. In-Game but let people pick the entire tournament in one go. This way we have a choice and we can lock our picks in one go. If we are horribly wrong, that's on us. At least we have a chance to play.\n\n3. In the official steam app. The app is there, can be verified and most likely people already have it.\n\n\nApologies for formatting.

Is Pick'em supposed to be used for blind betting? What should my 3-0 team selection depend on? How can you predict anything without knowing the map in BO1?
