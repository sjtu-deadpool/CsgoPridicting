The string of grand final finishes, the previous major victory; **all for naught**.\"\n\nAll for naught? Really, Maui? \n\nI don't even say this as a huge Na'Vi fan, but this team has had a phenomenal year after Copenhagen, winning the Esports World Cup, ESL Pro League, and IEM Masters RIO with respectable grand final finishes in a few other events. But of course, the blemish of not making playoffs at Shanghai means it was all for naught, right? \n\nI'm sick of this dialogue. In terms of consecutive major wins, there hasn't been an \"era\" in CS since 2019. It's silly, and frankly sometimes a frustrating expectation that these analysts have of top teams, especially when Tier 1 CS has never been so competitive. \n\nWho the hell even wants an era anyways? In my opinion, CS was at its least interesting when Astralis was dumpstering every team and winning virtually every big event for years, and as someone who has been watching pro CS since 2014, I felt similarly about the NIP, Fnatic, and LG/SK eras as they were happening. Pro CS is so exciting **right now** because there is no definitive \"best team\" in the world. \n\nNow, should Na'Vi have met expectations of at least making playoffs this major? Yes, absolutely.\n\nHas Heroic had a hell of a run to make playoffs, scrapping together the \"rejects\" of old Heroic and going way further into the major cycle than their counterpart in Astralis? Also, yes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying that we can't hold top teams like Na'Vi to high standards, nor am I even saying that analysts aren't allowed to discuss their failure to meet expectations - but why does Na'Vi's failure have to be the first thing these analysts talk about, when Heroic's accomplishment is way more interesting and exciting, and overall a far more positive dialogue to bring to the viewers?\n\nTL;DR: Maui rubbed me the wrong way and I'm crying Na'Vi glazer tears about him saying that their accomplishments in 2024 were all for naught before even acknowledging Heroic's performance.\n\n", "post_score": 0, "post_author": "mdC__", "post_created_utc": "2024-12-08 19:48:19", "comment_count": 28}

While it was smoother than expected I failed when you had to turn to the left or right. With right hand mouse I was just as smooth or even smoother, could finish the map (ramp bugs prevented that though in my offline testing) and was even able to inspect my knife at the same time and experiment by jumping from one side of the ramp to the other just for fun.\n\nAlso key binds like P for noclip (insane keybind for noclip but it works for me) would be very uncomfortable if using the right hand for keyboard.\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm just overthinking, but this had me thinking on and off for months already...", "post_score": 0, "post_author": "litLizard_", "post_created_utc": "2024-12-08 01:43:22", "comment_count": 10}
{"post_id": "1h97dfi", "post_title": "CS2 Network Jitter: It‚Äôs Likely Your Connection, Not the Game", "post_body": "Like many CS2 players, I initially believed the network jitter issues I was experiencing were due to poor optimization of the game. The new netcode in CS2 seemed to be the culprit, especially since no other games on my system displayed such issues. However, after thorough testing and troubleshooting, I discovered that the problem wasn't with CS2‚Äîit was within my network setup. \n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n1. **Jitter Can Be Hidden in Other Games:** Even if you experience stable connections in other games or during standard internet usage, CS2's more sensitive netcode can expose underlying issues in your network. This is a critical point to consider before blaming the game itself.\n2. **Browser Ping and Jitter Tests Aren't Enough:** Traditional tools or browser-based latency tests often fail to capture the sporadic spikes causing the in-game issues. These tools usually measure stability over longer intervals and won't highlight brief network instabilities.\n3. **Use Tools Like PingPlotter:** To diagnose the problem effectively, I ran PingPlotter while playing CS2. This allowed me to visualize latency spikes and jitter as they occurred during gameplay. Without this targeted approach, I wouldn‚Äôt have identified the true cause of the problem.\n\n**A Common Misconception:**  \nMany players assume that CS2‚Äôs jitter is purely due to server or game optimization issues. While this can sometimes be true, it‚Äôs essential to rule out your own network as the source. In most cases, network jitter is caused by local factors like unstable Wi-Fi, powerline adapters, or interference on the network. Additionally, in CS2, it appears that when network jitter exceeds a certain threshold, it is converted into packet loss, significantly affecting gameplay.\n\n**My Recommendation:**  \nIf you're facing persistent network jitter in CS2, test your connection under similar conditions to gameplay. Use tools like PingPlotter to identify hidden spikes or inconsistencies in your connection. Focus on diagnosing your network infrastructure‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs powerline, Wi-Fi, or even routing issues.\n\nThese insights completely changed how I approached the issue and allowed me to significantly reduce jitter in CS2. Since I use powerline adapters, I took a closer look at my home network setup. By addressing and minimizing electrical interference within the circuit, I was able to eliminate the ping spikes. Hopefully, this explanation helps others identify and resolve similar network-related problems.", "post_score": 0, "post_author": "HaggiTV", "post_created_utc": "2024-12-08 01:15:36", "comment_count": 4}
