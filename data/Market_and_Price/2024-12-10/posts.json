Feel free to point me in which color in CS2 doesn't looks degraded  ?  The white is far more brighter in CSGO  , the black isnt grey  and blue  and pink are literally more vibrant and sharper. I think its the whole skins needs some adjustments to pop better in game. Not just blacks. Its not only black problem. The skins overall looks really washup in CS2 compared to CSGO and valve needs to improve it", "post_score": 0, "post_author": "Outrageous-Spend2733", "post_created_utc": "2024-12-10 14:14:18", "comment_count": 19, "comments": ["I think most of you don't know how lighting works.", "redditor finds out about shadows", "It is dark.

First thing I did after cs2 came was sell my asiimov.", "stattrak just look like it lost the emission altogether", "I believe all the assets are authored correctly. But the engine is doing a tone mapping/grading pass near the end. If you capture a frame with RenderDoc you will see it. I don't think there is a console command in the release build.", "Better than you", "Yes its even more washed up when in light and under shadow the black doesn't look Grey. Go outsideÂ ", "Itâ€™s already a bit goofy tbh", "I dont think so, Just needs to individually adjust the color of the skins again which is a lot of works honestly but hiring some community skins makers giving them some bucks will fix skins in no time. I have seen community skins makers are replicating 1:1 look from CSGO In CS2's lighting. Its just valve who never bothered to do all these work cause you know  they dont have the manpower.", "Turns out. If you go outside, you realize that real life isn't hyper saturated. True blacks arent really common.", "not that much i think, more realistic light and all that. sure, most of the skins were made on the old engine but if they bring the light levels back it will look like some shining stick or a flashlight in your hands that might get too distracting", ">Â I have seen community skins makers are replicating 1:1 look from CSGO In CS2's lighting\n\nwell, this is probably skin makers' problem if they don't want to redo their skins. valve already have things to do with the game itself, instead of fixing every skin in the game", "Probably most nonsensical opinion i have seen yet. Honestly wtf ?Â  Flashlight ðŸ¤£", "Itâ€™s really because the lighting/engine is not made with skins in mind. Realistically thereâ€™s so much difference to how light reacts to with different materials, but in CS2 itâ€™s all just like when you shine the sun onto a photograph", "Its not your problem. The skins looks shit and it's a feedback to fix them\n\n\nYour random ass doesn't decide what they will fix and what thing's thye need to go.\n\n\nNo one asking your dumb opinionÂ ", "well, skin makers don't usually disclose what type of paint is used it their skins :). it can be matte, can be metallic", "Then why make this post at all? \n\nYour random ass isn't gonna do shit either."]}
